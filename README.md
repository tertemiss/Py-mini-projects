# Py-mini-projects

A collection of simple Python projects, implemented around 1.5 years ago. These projects are based on basic functions and do not include complex data structures. At the time, I wasn't aware of PEP-8

### Projects:

#### Drag_and_drop
A **Drag and Drop** system implemented using Pygame, with custom calculations for handling drag and drop operations.

#### Rock_scissors_paper
A **Rock, Paper, Scissors** console game with a bot featuring different strategies and new mechanics.

#### Game_of_life
An implementation of the **Conway's Game of Life** cellular automaton using Pygame.
